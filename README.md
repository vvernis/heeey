# HEEEY! - A Mobile Application to facilitate social connections for NTU EEE MSc Freshmen


Transitioning into university or a new country may seem daunting, but also inevitable for students. Smooth transition and integration are correlated with better academic performances for students. Hence, universities proactively facilitate outreaching events to help students acculturate to a new environment, especially for international students. 

In this project, a cross-platform mobile application, HEEEY!, aims to improve on the accessibility and outreach of social events through engaging and interactive activities. HEEEY! provides a platform for students to connect and forge friendships, featuring a matching system, innovative quests and a memory gallery showcasing moments during their social journey of exploring and adjusting.
